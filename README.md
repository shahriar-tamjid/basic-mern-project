# Basic MERN Project

### Introduction
This project is for understanding the fundamentals of a MERN application. In this README.md file I have listed all the steps I took to build a very simple MERN application which can perfrom CRUD operations.

### Steps

1. Created server.js file and wrote ```console.log("Hello from Node.js");```
2. Opened the terminal and wrote: ```node server.js``` --> that gave us the output

3. wrote: ```npm init -y``` --> That created a package.json which will keep track of all dependencies
4. Install Express.js --> ```npm install express```

5. After setting up basic web server if we go to terminal and type: ```node server.js``` then our teminal won't stop running
6. Now in the browser if we go to ```localhost:3000``` we will see our welcome message
7. If we go to ```localhost:3000/admin``` then we will see the welcome message for admins
8. So this is already the "E" and "N" of the "MERN" stack

9. We would use MongoDB locally on our machine
10. To do so we will need "Docker Desktop" (Note: We don't need to know anything about to docker in order to use it for managing our MongoDB)
